# meteor-react-sharetask
Meteor and React collaborative social app

Plan:
* (currently on this step) Utilizing the coursework, code and basic mockup framework as outlined in the Udemy React-Meteor course by Stephen Grider
* Next, I plan to add a few other sharing tools to the functionality.
* Will probably add Materialze for a Material Design look
* Then, I will refactor the code into a more modular codebase, where collaborative tools can be omitted or added.
